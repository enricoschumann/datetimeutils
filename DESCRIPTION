Description: Utilities for handling dates and times, such
   as selecting particular days of the week or month,
   formatting timestamps as required by RSS feeds, or
   converting timestamp representations of other
   software (such as MATLAB and Excel) to R. The package is
   lightweight (no dependencies, pure R implementations)
   and relies only on R's standard classes to represent
   dates and times (Date and POSIXt); it aims to provide
   efficient implementations, through vectorisation and the
   use of R's native numeric representations of timestamps
   where possible.
